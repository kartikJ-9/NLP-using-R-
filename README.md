# NLP-using-R-

NLP has a lot of applications. OMG!

This time I have followed this really cool article on NLP using R. 
Go check out the article: https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-text-classification-trump-v-obama-c09f947173dc

I have implemented the NLP using the article and I am looking forward to scrape some desi speech that has 'mitron' in it. 

Future Work:
To comeup with a term document matrix for the speeches of BJP and Congress, the 2 main parties of India and evaluate which party promotes hate politics and which party focuses on development.
